# HW
# Problem Statement: Maximum of two
# Given two integers, print the maximum of them.

# a = int(input("Enter the first number : "))
# b = int(input("Enter the second number : "))
# if a > b:
#     print("maximum number is : " ,a)
# else:

# HW
# Problem Statement: Maximum of two and check equality also
# Given two integers, print the maximum of them or say both are equal.

# a= int(input("Enter the first number : "))
# b = int(input("Enter the second number : "))
# if a>b:
#     print(a)
# elif a < b:
