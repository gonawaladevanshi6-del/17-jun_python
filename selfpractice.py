# 1. Positive, Negative, or Zero
# Problem Statement:
# Given an integer, print whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

# try:
#   a = int(input("Enter number : "))

#   if a > 0:
#     print("This is the positive number")
#   elif a < 0:
#     print("This is the negative number")
#   else:
#     print("This is the zero")
# except ValueError:
#   print("Invalid input, please enter valid input")

# 2. Maximum of Three Numbers
# Problem Statement:
# Given three integers, print the maximum number.
# a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
# b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
# c = int(input("Enter the third number: "))
# if a>b and a>c:
#     print("Maximum number is: ",  a)
# elif b>a and b>c :
#     print("Maximum number is : ", b)
# else:
#     print("Maximum number is : ", c)


# 3. Check Divisibility
# Problem Statement:
# Given an integer, check whether it is divisible by 5.
# a = int(input("Enter the number : "))
# if a%5 == 0:
#     print("The number is divided by 5")
# else:
#     print("The number is not divided by 5, enter other number")

### 🧠 One line to memorize

# **`/` = division, `//` = quotient, `%` = remainder.**

# And for **"is it divisible?"**, think:

# **`number % divisor == 0`**.

# # Take two numbers from the user
# a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
# b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# # Normal division
# print("Normal division:", a / b)

# # Quotient
# print("Quotient:", a // b)

# # Remainder
# print("Remainder:", a % b)


# 4. Voting Eligibility
# Problem Statement:
# Given a person's age, check whether they are eligible to vote.

# If age is 18 or above → Eligible
# # Otherwise → Not eligible
# a = int(input("Please enter your age to valid you are eligible for vote or not : "))
# if a >= 18:
#     print("You can give vote")
# else:
#     print("You are not eligble for vote")


# 5. Grade Calculator ⭐
# Problem Statement:
# Given a student's marks, print their grade:

# 90–100 → A
# 80–89 → B
# 70–79 → C
# 60–69 → D
# # Below 60 → F
# try:
#     a = int(input("Please enter your marks: "))
#     if a >=90 and a<=100:
#         print("Your grade is A")
#     elif a >=80 and a<=89:
#         print("Your grade is B")
#     elif a >=70 and a<=79:
#         print("Your grade is C")
#     elif a >=60 and a<=69:
#         print("Your grade is D")
#     elif a<60:
#         print("Your grade is F")
#     else:
#         print("This marks is not valid")
# except ValueError:
#      print("Enter valid number")


# OR 

# if a >= 90:
#     print("A")
# elif a >= 80:
#     print("B")
# elif a >= 70:
#     print("C")
# elif a >= 60:

# Question 1 — Leap Year Checker ⭐⭐
# Problem Statement:
# Take a year from the user and check whether it is a leap year or not.

# year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# if year % 400 == 0 or (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0):
#     print("Leap Year")
# else:
#     print("Not a Leap Year")
